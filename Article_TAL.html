		<h2>Take A Leap</h2><h3><i>Teagan Graham</i></h3>
		<br><br><br><br>

		<hr>
		<p>If you’re 100% sure what career you want and you're ready to jump straight in, if you don’t need a break and have no interest in travelling or adventure, this article isn’t for you. Otherwise, grab a cuppa, put your feet up and give this a read.</p>
		<p>When you're 13 you need to start thinking about your future, at 15 you must have some idea, at 17 you should know what you’re doing. Standard “expectations” for high schoolers are scary, frustrating and stressful. Take maths, sciences, English all the way through, have a good social life, get top marks, never break the rules. Sound familiar? </p>
		<p>At 17, life’s reality can hit you in the face. Take that step from high school and you can do anything. The big question is, where do you begin? It’s something people often wish they didn't have to think about. Avoid, avoid, avoid. It’s too simple to take the "easy" option, not necessarily the best. Do you feel rushed into making a decision supposedly determining the rest of your life? Olivia Adamson - a former high school student - says she felt “full of fear”, avoiding the “what do you want to do next year?” questions at all costs. <i>“I wasn’t prepared to have a discussion about it when I was still trying to find my feet”. </i></p>
		<p>A survey I conducted got over 80 responses including opinions on gap years and people’s personal experience. To clarify, I’m talking about taking a one year break, before you get back into study or going into full-time work. Most people I surveyed went straight into further study, for reasons like money, commitment, motivation, expectations, pressure. But, 2, 5 or 30 years later, nearly every one of them wish they had taken a gap year. One person responded, <i>“I’m at university now, and regret not taking a gap year first. You’re the youngest in your course as most people don’t come from school. I have a student loan which needs paying off so the gap year will have to wait”.</i></p> 
		<p>Working’s a great idea. You earn money, get experience and meet new people. But, you have your whole life to work. Is this straight-out-of-school job something you’ll want to make a life from? I don’t know about you but I want to wake up each morning buzzing to see what’s in store for me, not looking forward to the moment I get back into bed. Although my bed is pretty comfy.
		I’m assuming you want an awesome life with an awesome job. Often, that awesome life and job require a qualification or two. Unless you're a tradie or farmer, chances are you're going to spend 100 years paying off your student loan to feel that excitement every morning. Olivia says <i>“Don’t rush, at that age you have the world at your feet!”</i></p>
		<p>What's one year going to change? Not much if you don't take it, but you'll always wonder what if you had. </p>
		<p>University. A higher qualification, road to a good career and a world of hangovers. It’s the most socially “accepted” option. University’s a place where young people rush into doing degrees they may not use, wasting money on something they shouldn't be.</p>
		<p>I think if you 100% know what you want to study and don’t want a break, go for it. But, if you aren’t sure, take a gap year, gain work experience and maybe even some dollars. Or, go overseas and get life experience. As Olivia says, <i>“Expand your knowledge first with life experience and then a textbook”.</i></p>
		<p>When I asked people for advice they’d give to someone in their last year of school I got responses like <i>“Pick somewhere in the world, save and buy a ticket! You’ll never ever regret it I can promise you. There’s no rush to go to uni and start a career, you won’t ‘forget how to study”.</i> A gap year could have you deep in a journey of self-discovery, withdrawing some doubt about your future. People take gap years because they don’t know what they want to study, or they’ve been in school for 13 years and need a break. <i>“I just wasn’t ready to commit straight after high school. I still needed to learn a lot about myself before I went and threw myself into the next phase of life”</i> Olivia says her gap year was the best thing she could’ve done.</p> 
		<p>We're always worried about what we're going to lose, not focusing on what we could gain. Studying will give you a qualification and parties. Sounds good. A gap year gives you life experience, time to figure out who you are and what you want to do, a break from study, a chance to see the world. You can still party. That qualification will still be waiting for you. Even better. Olivia says <i>“If you want to travel, don’t suppress that craving because you feel university or a career is more worthwhile, there’s plenty of time later”.</i> If you take a gap year, you’re gaining a lot more than if you don’t. </p>
		<p>Sure, you can study first, then travel. Now you’ve got a student loan to pay off and likely job opportunities you don’t want to turn down. You’ve missed your chance for a year's break, it turns into finding time to go on holiday. Olivia highly recommends a gap year, as a <i>“huge learning curve…”</i><i> “the exposure to the real world can’t be taught through books and lectures”.</i> A survey response read, <i>“Don’t do what you think you should, do what you think you’ll love”. </i></p>
		<p>I’m trying to prove that taking a gap year is okay, in fact much more than okay. Imagine the 96 year old version of you, what would she/he think? How do you want to reflect on your life? I want to look back on the awesome things I’ve seen and done. That doesn’t always mean being caught up in the real world, if you need time to escape, take it. It’s one year. </p>
