		<h2>The Death Of Art</h2><h3><i>Sarah Van Eeden</i></h3>
		<br><br><br><br>
		<hr>
		<P><b><i>“Art is life, and I cannot survive without it. It helps me to get through hard times and it gives me an outlet for my expression.”</i></b></P>
		<p><b>Sarah Van Eeden investigates what’s happening to the art curriculum.</b></p>
		<P>Art is under attack. It is being pulled from the curriculum of schools and Universities, nationally and internationally. In the UK they are trying to funnel out art subjects in schools, and replace them with ‘core’ subjects. In US art is not respected. In New Zealand Art is changing.</P>
		<P>The English Baccalaureate (EBacc) qualification was introduced in 2011 in the UK. Students are required to gain good GCSEs in two sciences, English and Maths, a language and either History or Geography. This could push schools away from offering arts subjects, because they feel that it would overload the students. The Cultural Learning Alliance were concerned that it would be the death of art subjects.</P>
		<P>The Warwick Commission on the Future of Cultural Values, found that between 2003 and 2013 there was a 50% drop in GCSE entries for design and technology, 23% for drama and 25% for other craft-related subjects. The Cultural Learning Alliance’s concerns were coming true. Students were becoming overloaded and rejecting art subjects.</P>
		<P>Danny Gregory, an American blogger says that some states in the US think that art subjects shouldn’t be taught in schools, because “Art” is not respected in America. It’s seen a silliness, a luxury, a way to keep kids busy with crayons and paper. According to him “Art” is an upper class luxury that hard-nosed bureaucrats know they can remove without punishment, so they do. Bureaucrats make Maths and Science the priority to fill the ranks of future bankers, accountants and lawyers.</P> 
		<P>He thinks that art is important, because it helps to solve the world’s problems. We need to make sure that kids in today’s society realize just how much creative potential they have, and have the tools to help them use that creativity. We need creative people in today’s society. <I>“Creativity is not a ghetto”</I> says Danny Gregory <I>“not a clique, not something to be exercised alone in a garret. It’s also not a freak show of self-indulgent divas and losers.”</I></P> 
		<P><I>“It’s also not a freak show of self-indulgent divas and losers.”</I></P>
		<P>New Zealanders are artistic people, who believe that being involved in the arts makes communities stronger and people’s lives better. <I>“Nine out of ten adult New Zealanders (88%) agree the arts are good for them and eight out of ten (82%) agree that the arts help to improve New Zealand society.”</I> says Creative New Zealand. </P>
		<P>Art is very important in New Zealand. The creative industries are struggling to get enough people for all the creative jobs they have. Many companies are bringing people from overseas. </P>
		<P>Take for example WETA Workshop. <I>Weta Workshop bring not only world class artistic and technical talent to what they do, they also bring a spirit and a passion which is invigorating for the filmmaker.”</I>“ says Canadian filmmaker James Cameron. But with their growing international reputation WETA has had to apply for over 400 work visas in just one year to fill its vacancies.</P>
		<P>Art is changing in New Zealand and this is why the industry struggle to get all the people needed for those jobs. It is hard to get the qualifications and experience required. It’s either unaffordable for people or they don’t meet the entire requirements, or are pressured into going for a different career.</P>
		<P>Bruce McMillan worked in professional art studios for about 15 years, but became tired of that. So he moved out to the country and had a little art business that he ran from home, while working as a shearer. He would shear sheep in the season, then make art in the off season. When he was 38, he decided he would love to go back to art school, so he did. Then it was suggested to him that art teaching could be a good career for him.</P>
		<P>Early in his life he wore hearing aids, so he didn’t hear very well. But he had some operations that fixed that, so he thought <I>“here is my opportunity”.</I> He went to art school and training college  and got a job at RHS as his first teaching job. He believes art is a very important part of the education of a well rounded person. pointing out that <I>“Humans drew on cave walls before they had language”.</I></P>
		<P>Yes,  Art schools struggle to get students, but art is changing not dying. The discipline of design and the applied arts as taught in Polytechs are still strong. We live in a visual world and learning to understand the power of images is important. It teaches students to tell stories about their world. On a broad scale making art is part of what makes us human.</P> 
		<P>Art is a weapon, entertainment, an expression, a way to explore new ideas and expand your creativity. It’s speaking up against the wrongs, and the rights in the world. It gives us the freedom to be who we are and be unique.</P>
