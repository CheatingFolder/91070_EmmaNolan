		<h2>Rick Rubens</h2><h3><i>Sarah Van Eeden</i></h3>
		<br><BR><BR><br>
		<hr>
		<p>Rick Rubens is specialized in creating one-off statement pieces of furniture and wall art. He mainly uses reclaimed materials. He professionally crafts to designer standards, Rick’s selection of high quality pieces are specifically created for individuals who appreciate art and unique style.</p>
		<p>When he thinks of artists, he thinks of painters, sculptors and people who have studied art. He has never studied it, but has always being creating it. <I>“I never considered myself in that field, I saw myself purely as someone who does up old furniture,”</I> says Rick Rubens.</p>
		<p>After a few years he was persuaded by quite a few people that what he was doing was an art form, and he should market myself as an artist. That was the furthest thing from his mind that he was creating art. He still feels a degree uncomfortable with being called an artist. People say it doesn’t matter whether you have studied it, if you create art you are an artist.</p>
		<p>He rarely draws his works first, he lets the materials available dictate to a certain extent what he’ll do. He works from his mind’s eye for all of his work. The final outcome remains fluid throughout the process, to adapt to the challenges faced when using reclaimed materials and the inspirations that come along the way.</p>
		<p>People often ask him where his inspiration comes from and are often surprised to hear that he doesn’t actively look for inspiration. He is not saying that he doesn’t look at what is being created by others, but if it’s been done he tries to avoid doing similar work.</p>
		<p>He believes in sustainability and uses reclaimed materials and old furniture. What he loves the most about using the old furniture and reclaimed material is the transformation from something unloved and sometimes destined for landfill. Wood is his favourite material. A plain old piece of wood or an old bed frame can be made into something quite special. It can take on so many different appearances, has so many uses, can be easily recycled and given a brand-new life.</p>
		<p>He is from the UK, but has been in New Zealand for years now and really enjoys it here. He didn’t decide to upcycle furniture, it came about. When he started upcycling furniture, it was a fairly new expression, where you take something and make it better than it was originally. By making it either of better value or better aesthetic appeal. He loves what he does, but doing it commercially does take some of the enjoyment out of it.</p>
		<p><I>“People say it doesn’t matter whether you have studied it, if you create art you are an artist.”</I></p>
		<P>Rick first started selling his work on Trade Me, but now sells it from his website <a target="blank" href="http://www.rickrubens.co.nz">www.rickrubens.co.nz</a> and at some galleries. He is hoping to find places to sell his work in Auckland and is exploring the possibility of selling his work in the UK, where there is a mature market place for his type of work.</P>
		<p>Rick Rubens has excellent attention to detail, his artworks are beautiful and extremely well made. Each piece he makes are unique one-off pieces, made with exceptional craftsmanship and exceed his client’s expectations.</p>
