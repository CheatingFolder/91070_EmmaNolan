		<h2>Off The Grid</h2><h3><i>Andy Baker</i></h3>
		<br><br><br><br>
		<hr>
		<P>Staying inside is lame, and some activities that most teenagers are doing are indoors. It’s keeping people from going off grid and seeing the true beauties of this world. In a country like New Zealand you are always close to some amazing scenery and nature ready to be explored.</P>
		<P>The number of adventures that can take place are endless, and some will be the best times, and worst times of your life. Get your friends together and go camping, or even a one day hike. Yeah, you’re gonna have to put your phone down for a bit, or even a couple days, but you’ll have a much better time than you do scrolling down your Facebook feed. Taking a camera is always super cool, and if you don’t have a camera that’s always an excuse to have your phone with you. If you need more motivation to leave Wi-Fi behind, imagine the photos you can take while at the top of a mountain or perched up by a river. These will make some super crispy Instagram posts when you get back home. Temporarily getting rid of your technological devices can really allow you to decompress without the pressure of electronics. </P>
		<P>Being outside can be so inspirational, and can really get your mind thinking creatively. The surroundings really allow your mind to be at ease. Going camping may sound like a lot of effort, but it’s one of the greatest things to do. Waking up to the sun rising with stunning views beats waking up hungover at 1:30 in the afternoon. Filling a car with friends and camping gear is all you need, just take some food, cooking utensils, spare clothes, sleeping gear and a tent (or not). If it’s the middle of summer and the nights are super warm, sleeping outside can also be an option. Looking up at the night sky with the numerous amounts of stars while falling asleep is crazy.</P>
		<P>Camping can be as simple as pitching a tent at a nice spot down at the river for a night to get away from everything, giving you some real quiet time. Cooking while camping is such a different experience compared to cooking at home. You’ll be smoking up some sausages or having some chargrilled bacon over the fire. The more you camp, the more you will enjoy it, and soon it’ll evolve into 5 day trips hundreds of kilometres away from home. Camping really helps you reconnect with nature, helping develop your appreciation for nature and respect for the world around you. One of the best things about being outside is the exercise as there is plenty of ways to keep moving while outdoors. Small camps can get you prepared for travelling, as camping while travelling would offer some incredible different sights and spots. It will save you a couple bucks on accommodation as well. Camping definitely reconnects you with one another as you will be in the middle of nowhere, only with your group of mates and the hopefully good vibes. A great thing about going outdoors with a group is that everyone has different skills, so you will always learn something new, which could be as simple as starting a fire or even catching a fish. </P>
		<P>The number one reason to go outside is because it’s fun. No explanation needed. Sitting round a fire with a view of the sun setting down behind the mountain ranges, all you can hear is the sound of fresh running water and the soft crackle of the fire. Beats a night partying, well at least in my opinion anyway. And if your life depends that much on alcohol, why not take some with you? Have a small party with your mates, definitely better than getting wasted at some random’s house party. After a small getaway, you will have a different mindset on it all, and will definitely be thinking about your future trips. I know all this from personal experience, and camping is now one of my favourite ways to spend weekends and holidays. Alright why are you still reading this article? Surely you should be on the road by now, or at least planning it. Go outside, and have fun. </P>
